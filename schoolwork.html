            In this portion, I've only listed my big projects that I've worked on. There are plenty of more Classwork
            material and assignments that I've worked on, but I only want to signify the highly collaborative work. In 
            these projects, I played a significant role in leading communications and programming. Due to regulations
            regarding shared code via assignments, I'll post the video and screenshots of the projects on this page.

            <p>In this project, I learned about the use of AGILE methodology. We had 3 separate sprints. FOr
                the
                first sprint, I was the programmer doing research and development for the frameworks we were
                going
                to use. For the second sprint, I was the
                Scrum Master distributing roles and timelines for when issues should be populated. We used
                an
                application called Zenhub to track our team's progress. On our final sprint, I was the
                Project
                Manager working on presenting our final product.
                Our product is a real-time database that monitors Mercury Messenger's application. This was
                a
                two-team project, so we had to collaborate with the other team's app and get it to connect.
                This was
                the most challenging, yet most rewarding
                project yet.

                    <p>To start off with a simple project, I decided to make a short rock, paper, scissors game

                        play with the computer. It was something I wanted to do in order to try out other such

                        CSS. Play below, first to 3 wins!</p>
