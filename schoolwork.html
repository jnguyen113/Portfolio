                In this portion, I've only listed my big projects that I've worked on. There are plenty of more
                Classwork
                material and assignments that I've worked on, but I only want to signify the highly collaborative work.
                In
                these projects, I played a significant role in leading communications and programming. Due to
                regulations
                regarding shared code via assignments, I'll post the video and screenshots of the projects on this page.
                To see the live demo of the applications, please skip towards the end of the videos!

                    <p>
                        To start off the semester, we were introduced to HTML and CSS. My knowledge from the summer
                        projects helped
                        me tremendously in this project. I was the designated leader, and we decided to create a
                        Air-Hockey Table
                        from scratch along with using CSS animations to animate the paddles and puck.

                    <p>
                        In this project, we created a hangman game. I created the user registration system, which I used
                        PHP and
                        storing user data in a text file. This game has a small database in the text files that store
                        leaderboard
                        scores.

                    <p>In this project, I also worked on the registration system, except I was able to use
                        JavaScript. I decided to
                        learn more about Local Storage, so that is what I used to store user data locally, since it
                        is a local game.
                        It was important to have some verification checks like similar username, short passwords,
                        etc.

                    <p>
                        On our final project, we were able to use a database to store user information and inventory for
                        cars. I
                        decided to code the registration system using PHP used MySQL Database to store the data. I
                        learned about
                        a password hash function that allows the password to be hashed into the database giving more
                        privacy
                        protection for each user.

                        In this project, I initially came up with this idea and brought it upon the team members. I
                        gathered everyone
                        together and led the team by distributing tasks, designing the flowchart, and meeting
                        individually to help out
                        my other team members. This was a very rewarding project because my team scored very highly on
                        this project.
                        This app allows you to register with google, get workouts, and display local gym locations. We
                        had another member
                        that was in charge of an overview page, however, they dropped the course.

                    <p>In this project, I learned about the use of AGILE methodology. We had 3 separate sprints. For
                        the
                        first sprint, I was the programmer doing research and development for the frameworks we were
                        going
                        to use. For the second sprint, I was the
                        Scrum Master distributing roles and timelines for when issues should be populated. We used
                        an
                        application called Zenhub to track our team's progress. On our final sprint, I was the
                        Project
                        Manager working on presenting our final product.
                        Our product is a real-time database that monitors Mercury Messenger's application. This was
                        a
                        two-team project, so we had to collaborate with the other team's app and get it to connect.
                        This was
                        the most challenging, yet most rewarding
                        project yet.
