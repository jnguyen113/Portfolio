        <p>Welcome to my portfolio, I am a senior studying Computer Science
            at Georgia State University. In this portfolio, <br>
            I wanted to share how I learned to code and highlight some of my projects. I have attached my
            LinkedIn and Github in the top right hand corner. Below this are some of the projects that
            I have worked on by myself or school projects. Feel free to explore!</p>

            <p>In this project, I learned about the use of AGILE methodology. We had 3 separate sprints. FOr
                the
                first sprint, I was the programmer doing research and development for the frameworks we were
                going
                to use. For the second sprint, I was the
                Scrum Master distributing roles and timelines for when issues should be populated. We used
                an
                application called Zenhub to track our team's progress. On our final sprint, I was the
                Project
                Manager working on presenting our final product.
                Our product is a real-time database that monitors Mercury Messenger's application. This was
                a
                two-team project, so we had to collaborate with the other team's app and get it to connect.
                This was
                the most challenging, yet most rewarding
                project yet.

            <p>This contains all the work that I am currently working on in Web Programming. The summer has
                prepared
                me for this class, and I am still learning and implementing
                the knowledge gained in this class to my own personal projects. This portfolio only used
                HTML and
                CSS as it is one of our first assignments and we could not use
                other resources if it has not been taught yet. Feel free to check out the progression
                throughout my
                Web Programming Course!
