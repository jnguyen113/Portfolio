            <p>My name is Johnathan Nguyen and I wanted to share my journey with programming. I didn’t always enjoy
                coding,
                I started walking into my freshman year of college just as a Computer Science major because I always
                wanted to
                do something technical. I went into my first programming class and was completely lost. I remember the
                tests were
                so difficult and did not think I would make it through the class. I’ve had little to no experience with
                coding prior college.
                My friends were always telling me to switch to another major like Computer Information Systems, which is
                similar to
                Computer Science, but more business-related. However, that didn’t stick with me. My heart was telling me
                no, so
                I stuck with my guts and continued to keep my major as Computer Science. Entering into my sophomore
                year, one of
                my good friends I met in one of my CS classes switched his major to CIS, so I began asking him was it
                the right
                move for him? He kept telling me yes and how it’s less coding and how he liked it more. My sophomore
                year was
                pretty tough, this was when I started taking more CS classes and it only got harder. Now was when I
                really
                doubted myself and said, is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life? If I switch majors
                now, I’ll be so behind. I continued to stick with my guts and pursued my education in Computer Science.
                Now junior year came by and my life changed. I was a part-time advisor for Apple and still a full-time
                student at GSU. Facebook had a program with GSU where they were sending their engineers in residence to
                come to
                teach us. This professor that taught me Data Structures and Algorithms completely changed my view of
                coding. He
                told me all coding is really about is problem-solving. If you like problem-solving, you’ll love coding.
                I thought
                about it and it’s true. You are given a problem to solve, and you solve it by telling the computer what
                you want
                it to do. Sounds simple right? This professor gave me confidence that I chose the right major and wanted
                to keep
                doing this. This was the year that I’ve learned the most out of my entire time at GSU. Right before that
                semester
                ended, I landed my first internship as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst Intern at OneTrust for the
                Summer of
                2020. Well, the entire world entered into one of the biggest pandemics we have faced. Covid-19 was
                spreading so
                rapidly. My internship was rescinded 5 days before the start date. At this time, I was still working for
                Apple,
                but I told them I was leaving because I had an internship lined up. Well the Summer of 2020 could’ve
                been a disaster.
                I had very little time to react, but I wasn’t mad at the company or anything. I understood that it
                wasn’t just me that
                this pandemic has affected. I still could have stayed with Apple and would have been moving up with
                them, but I
                wanted to take this time to truly learn code. I decided to quit my job at Apple and follow what I was
                passionate
                about. I viewed this an a door that opened me up to more opportunities. With so much time home, I did
                Hackerrank
                problems every day, learned to build this portfolio, and worked on many group projects with my friends.
                I've only
                also dealt with Java at GSU, and wanted to explore other languages. I started learning HTMl, Javascript,
                and CSS
                and absolutely loved it. The idea of being in control and solving problems became something I enjoyed
                more everyday.
                I knew everything happened for a reason, and my instructor told me that this summer is all going to be
                up to my mentality
                and how productive I’ll be. I didn’t want to waste 3 months of summer playing games all day or anything
                similar
                to it. Shortly after, I joined a company called HackYourOwn. At first, I started of as a Software
                Engineer Intern. During this time,
                I programmed a bot that would manage teams and members. Our channel grew to 1,000 members quick! Then,
                the founder really needed help,
                so I wanted to serve the community in any way that I could. Eventually, I moved up roles and became a
                Global Community Lead, where I created a
                project track for members that joined and managed teams on their performance. The Summer of 2020 was
                definitely a summer
                I'll never forget. You don't have the ability to control what goes on in the world, but you can control
                your mentality towards it.
                With the knowledge I have gained over the summer, I have graudated from university with Summa Cum Laude
                and received the Outstanding Senior Award
                fromt he GSU CS Honors and Awards
                Committee.

                    <p>This company gave me hope for the Summer of 2020! They've introduced me to Web Programming and 
                        sparked my interest in becoming a Web Developer. Not only this, but I was able to use my 
                        communication and leadership skills to help the non-profit organization grow. I worked with 
                        HackYourOwn for the entirety of Summer 2021.
